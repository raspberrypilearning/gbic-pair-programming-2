## Introduction

You will be using the Pair Programming approach to teach pupils to program drawings and animations in Scratch 3. Learners need not be familiar with programming or Scratch 3 at the start of the project. Educators should be familiar with the Scratch 3 user interface, blocks, Programming Area, characters, and backgrounds. Each lesson plan offers detailed references to subject knowledge and includes step-by-step instructions, so teachers will have the chance to familiarise themselves with the required elements before the lessons.

This session focuses on building up your expertise in advance of the project, as well as familiarising yourself with the resources. Over the rest of this online course, you will have an opportunity to explore all the resources for yourself, try them out, and think about how to implement the sessions in your own classroom.


## Accessing the resources

First, you are going to access the session resources that you will need for the Pair Programming project.

--- task ---
Open the Pair Programming resource portal, where you can explore all the resources for Lessons 1 to 12. The webpage is the access portal for all the resources relating to the Pair Programming project. 

--- /task ---

The resources prepared for the trial period include twelve 1-hour lessons which have been newly-developed for the current project. The first lesson provided is an introduction to Pair Programming. Following the introductory lesson are two subsequent Programming Units (with 11 lessons in total) which embed Pair Programming throughout, with some focused Pair Programming activities incorporated within each lesson. Pupils learn to produce drawings and animations using key programming concepts, such as repetition, sequencing and selection.

The main resources folder consists of four subfolders: Introduction to Pair Programming, Unit 1_Programming-Drawing, Unit 2_Programming-Animation, and Units Overview. Lesson plans, slides and any additional resources are provided for each lesson with the relevant subfolder. In the Units Overview subfolder, you will also find a set of slides with Pair Programming prompts, which you can use as additional activities in your lessons (some are already incorporated into the lesson slides). This will encourage pupils to keep thinking about the process of Pair Programming and how best to work together.

Feel free to download the resources or access them each time you need them from the webpage. You may wish to bookmark the link to the resources in the browser toolbar of your tablet/iPad/computer for ease of reference in the classroom. You can also find links to all of the resources in your Project Guide and Units Overview.
