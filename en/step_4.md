## Pairing pupils

Ideally, pairings should begin during the Introduction to Pair Programming lesson and remain the same until the end of Unit 1. Pupils could then change pairings at the beginning of Unit 2, if it is felt to be necessary or beneficial. It is not recommended to change pupil pairings more often because pairings need some time to develop appropriate ways of working together as part of the Pair Programming approach. Potential pairings could be between pupils with relatively more or less advanced skills, or between pupils who have similar attitudes towards classwork or a 'social affinity'. 

For pupils with more advanced skills, this is a learning opportunity to develop logical reasoning and explain concepts, which they may previously have instinctively understood, in new or improved ways. For pupils with less advanced skills, it is an opportunity to see how to carry out tasks, including digital literacy tasks such as saving a file or running a program. Some approaches to Pair Programming subtly assign slightly more time to pupils with less advanced skills when they are drivers. Please note that the difference in skill levels between the pupils should not be too large.

The pairings must be decided by the teacher in advance of the first lesson. It is useful for the pupils to see the class seating plan in the presentation - see the template seating plan in the resource folder for Introduction to Pair Programming. 

### A few top tips for pairing pupils:
+ An initial investment of time in pairing learners can both help optimise the benefits of Pair Programming and avoid one pupil dominating the other
+ Ensure that pupils are implementing Pair Programming:
  + Provide ‘Maps to successful pairing’ at each pair’s computer station at the start of each lesson.
  + Circulate throughout the lessons
  + Stand back and observe the class of pairs: pupils should be animated and discussing code. Provide reminders about the roles of the Navigator and the Driver using the prompts provided throughout the lesson and encourage discussion between pairs
  + Interact with paired pupils together, rather than speaking to them individually
+ Check in regularly with the pairs to make sure that they are working well together
