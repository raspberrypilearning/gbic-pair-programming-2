As well as thinking about the ground rules for successful pairing, it's important to consider how best to set up your classroom to allow pupils to work effectively in pairs.

## Pairing pupils

Ideally, pairings should begin during the 'Introduction to Pair Programming' lesson and remain the same until the end of Unit 1. Pupils could then change pairings at the beginning of Unit 2, if it is felt to be necessary or beneficial. It is not recommended to change pupil pairings more often because pairings need some time to develop appropriate ways of working together as part of the 'Pair Programming' approach. Potential pairings could be between pupils with relatively more or less advanced skills, or between pupils who have similar attitudes towards classwork or a 'social affinity'. 

For pupils with more advanced skills, this is a learning opportunity to develop logical reasoning and explain concepts, which they may previously have instinctively understood, in new or improved ways. For pupils with less advanced skills, it is an opportunity to see how to carry out tasks, including digital literacy tasks such as saving a file or running a program. Some approaches to Pair Programming subtly assign slightly more time to pupils with less advanced skills when they are drivers. Please note that the difference in skill levels between the pupils should not be too large.

The pairings must be decided by the teacher in advance of the first lesson. It is useful for the pupils to see the class seating plan in the presentation â€” see the template seating plan in the 'Introduction to Pair Programming' resource folder.

### A few top tips for pairing pupils
+ An initial investment of time in pairing pupils can both help optimise the benefits of Pair Programming and avoid one pupil dominating the other
+ To ensure that pupils are implementing Pair Programming:
  + Circulate throughout the lessons
  + Stand back and observe the class of pairs: pupils should be animated and discussing code. Provide reminders about the roles of the navigator and the driver using the prompts provided throughout the lesson and encourage discussion between pupils
  + Interact with paired pupils together, rather than speaking to them individually
+ Check on the pairs regularly to make sure that they are working well together

## Timing

We recommend that pupils swap roles every five minutes, depending on the task. This is flexible and needs to be monitored, it might need to be varied according to your class and/or the task.

It is easiest to use an automated timer to signal to your pupils when they need to switch roles. You can use either an online digital timer or your mobile device, although if you are focusing on teaching delivery, you may find a phone distracting.

There are lots of free online stopwatches available, for example, [Google Timer](https://www.google.com/search?q=google+timer&rlz=1C1CHBF_enGB860GB861&oq=google+timer&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.1420j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)  or [online clock](http://www.timer.onlineclock.net). Stopwatches that just show seconds and minutes work best. Make sure that the sound is turned up on your computer so that pupils can hear when they need to change roles.

## Classroom setup

Make sure that you have enough space for two pupils to comfortably share a computer. As you saw in the video in the previous session, it is easier for pupils to simply move the keyboard and mouse over to the driver as they swap roles, rather than swapping seats after every five-minute interval. This minimises disruption and allows pupils to concentrate on the programming task at hand. Also ensure that each pair has their 'Map to successful pairing' so that they can review and reflect on their pair work in every lesson.
