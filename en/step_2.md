## Task 1: Technical setup for the project

Check that you are prepared for the project. This step is the first in a series of tasks to make sure that the technical setup is arranged well in advance of delivering the lessons. You will need to install an app or software to the class devices and you may need to bring in expertise, seek permissions, or source additional hardware. 

**Scratch 3**
You will need to choose whether your class will create programs using Scratch 3 online in a web browser, or using a version of Scratch 3 that has been downloaded to use offline on local computers. Your decision should be based on factors such as school policy on the use of online applications and whether the school has a reliable internet connection. You should check which option would be best in your school with your school’s network/IT manager. 

Scratch 3 can be used on touchscreen devices such as iPads, Android tablets, and Windows tablets and touchscreen computers if necessary. There are some differences in how it can be used on these devices, which you can learn more about on the [Code Club website](https://help.codeclub.org/en/support/solutions/articles/19000098299-using-scratch-3-on-a-tablet-or-touchscreen-device). Bear in mind that if you are not using a desktop computer, projects cannot be saved and so pupils will need Scratch accounts when using other devices.

If you are using Scratch online, teachers can set up a [teacher account](https://scratch.mit.edu/educators/faq) and then set up accounts for the pairs of pupils in their class. See the Units overview, Section 4 for more details about the process.

--- task --- Read Section 4 of the [Units overview](ncce.io/R2iy6p) and decide whether you will use the online or offline editor. If you do not already have Scratch 3 set up for your teaching, make sure you have downloaded it or set up a teacher account for online use. Set up online accounts or offline folders to save pupils' work.

**Devices and live demonstrations**
Ideally, all demonstrations of programming should be done live. You should set up well in advance of delivering the lessons as you may need to bring in expertise, seek permissions, or source additional hardware. 

If you are running the demonstration from a desktop computer or laptop, connect the computer or laptop to an interactive whiteboard or screen in the classroom.

If you are running the demonstration from a tablet/iPad, you will be able to choose Bluetooth connectivity, wireless LAN connectivity, or connectivity through hardware (such as an HDMI AV adapter):
+ Android tablet — search online for 'screen mirroring' with the make/model of your device
+ iPad — follow [information on AirPlay](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204289) or [information on AV adapters](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202044)
