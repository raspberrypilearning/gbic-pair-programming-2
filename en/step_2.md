## Task 1: Technical setup for the project

Check that you are prepared for the project. This step is the first in a series of tasks in order to ensure that the technical setup is arranged well in advance of delivering the lessons. You will need to install an app or software to the class devices and you may need to bring in expertise, seek permissions, or source additional hardware. 

**Scratch 3**
You will need to choose whether your class will create programs using Scratch 3 online in a web browser, or using a version of Scratch 3 which has been downloaded to use offline on local computers. Your decision will be based on factors such as school policy on the use of online applications and whether the school has a reliable internet connection. You should check with your school’s network/IT manager which option is best in your school. 

Scratch 3 can be used on touchscreen devices such as iPads, Android tablets, and Windows tablets and touchscreen computers if necessary. There are some differences in how it can be used on these devices, which you can learn more about on the [Code Club website](https://help.codeclub.org/en/support/solutions/articles/19000098299-using-scratch-3-on-a-tablet-or-touchscreen-device). Bear in mind that if you are not using a desktop computer, projects cannot be saved and so pupils will need Scratch accounts when using other devices.

If you are using Scratch online, teachers can set up a [Teacher Account](https://scratch.mit.edu/educators/faq) and then set up accounts for the pairs of pupils in their class. See the Units Overview, Section 4 for more details about the process.

--- task --- Read Section 4 of the Units Overview (link) and decide whether you will use the online or offline editor. If you do not already have Scratch 3 set up for your teaching, make sure you have downloaded it or set up a Teacher Account for online use. Set up online accounts or offline folders for saving pupils' work.

**Devices and live demonstrations**
Ideally, all demonstrations of programming should be done live. Set up well in advance of delivering the lessons as you may need to bring in expertise, seek permissions, or source additional hardware. 

For tablets/iPad, you will be able to choose between Bluetooth connectivity, wireless LAN connectivity, or connectivity through hardware (such as an HDMI AV adapter):
+ Android tablet — search online for "screen mirroring" with the make/model of your device.
+ iPad — follow [information on AirPlay](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204289) or [information on AV adapters](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202044). 
+ Desktop computer — it is possible to demonstrate from the teacher's interactive whiteboard or an alternative monitor.
