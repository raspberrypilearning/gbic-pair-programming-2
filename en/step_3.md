You should now take some time to read through the Units Overview and Lesson Plans. We've also outlined some key tasks below to help you explore the resources. Allowing yourself time for preparation now will make it easier to incorporate the Pair Programming teaching approach into your lessons when the project begins.

Make a note of anything that you need to clarify. You can also get in touch with us by email if you have any queries at any time before, during, or after the project by emailing the Gender Balance in Computing research team at [genderresearch@raspberrypi.org](mailto:genderresearch@raspberrypi.org).


## Live demonstrations

In this task, you will work through the live programming demonstrations in the lesson plans. 

--- task --- 
Work through the lesson plans and associated slides for Units 1 and 2 highlight any activities using live demonstrations. Set up Scratch 3 and practice the activities that you have highlighted, making sure that you are familiar with the instructions and confident that the outputs of the programs are what you expect. This preparation will help the lessons to run more smoothly.

## Pair Programming guidelines

In the Introduction to Pair Programming subfolder, different templates have been provided for pupils to record the ground rules for their pairing: a map and a steering wheel. These templates will be given to pairs in every lesson to remind them of the ground rules they have chosen, and to allow them to reflect on how well they are working within these ground rules. 

--- task --- 
Take some time to investigate the different templates and consider how you will support your pupils to develop appropriate ground rules. Are there any particular rules that you think are the most important for your own pupils?
